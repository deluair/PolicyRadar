# PolicyRadar

## Executive Summary

Develop a comprehensive Python-based economic policy impact assessment system that enables Fortune 500 multinational corporations to anticipate regulatory changes 6-12 months in advance and quantify their financial implications across multiple jurisdictions. The system should demonstrate capabilities that economic consulting firms (Charles River Associates, NERA Economic Consulting, Analysis Group) value when hiring PhD economists with central bank and policy experience.

## Problem Context

Multinational corporations face unprecedented economic policy volatility in 2025:
- **Trade Wars**: Escalating tariffs (baseline 10% on all imports, up to 50% on specific countries) disrupting global supply chains
- **Financial Regulations**: Basel III Endgame implementation requiring major capital restructuring by July 2025
- **Climate Policies**: Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) creating $394 billion in new incentives and compliance requirements
- **Industrial Policy**: CHIPS Act reshaping semiconductor and technology supply chains
- **Tax Reforms**: Potential changes as 2017 TCJA provisions expire in December 2025

Companies operating across 50+ countries need sophisticated early warning systems to navigate this complexity while maintaining profitability.
